		<p>I hate mornings. I love <a href="https://www.usa.edu/blog/how-to-work-night-shift-and-stay-healthy/">working overnights </a>and have done so for almost 6 years.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Try to get a into routine</li>
		<li>Have good sleep hygene</li>
		<li>Get into the mindset that this is normal and flip your mental clock by 12 hours to make it normal (for you at least!)</li>
